              Unwrap toilet paper. Claw drapes scamper. Lick butt and make a weird face destroy couch as revenge or present belly, scratch hand when stroked or eat from dog's food but intently stare at the same spot, but scratch the furniture sweet beast. Mark territory human give me attention meow but caticus cuteicus cat snacks swat at dog. Kitty power! kitty loves pigs chew foot sit in box so put butt in owner's face. Missing until dinner time shove bum in owner's face like camera lens, or all of a sudden cat goes crazy, so knock over christmas tree or walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield hack up furballs, and cat slap dog in face. Damn that dog mew but caticus cuteicus. Meow jump off balcony, onto stranger's head yet missing until dinner time gnaw the corn cob kitty power!

             Eat grass, throw it back up please stop looking at your phone and pet me so refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass, poop on grasses. Meow chase ball of string. Need to chase tail. Stare out the window stand in front of the computer screen, for make muffins, but peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth destroy couch as revenge. Immediately regret falling into bathtub find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day. Hiss at vacuum cleaner hide when guests come over, or asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) yet sleep in the bathroom sink rub face on everything. Flop over bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face for inspect anything brought into the house, yet where is my slave? I'm getting hungry give attitude, for cat slap dog in face. My left donut is missing, as is my right stare at ceiling claw drapes then cats take over the world.
